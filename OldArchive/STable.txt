PROBLEM STATEMENT

You are given two strings s and t. All characters of s and t are distinct. No character of s is present in t and no character of t is present in s.

Let N be the length of s, and M be the length of t.
Define a 2-dimensional string array "table" as follows:

table[i][0] = s[i-1] (1<=i<=N)
table[0][j] = t[j-1] (1<=j<=M)
table[i][j] = min(table[i-1][j], table[i][j-1]) + max(table[i-1][j], table[i][j-1])  (1<=i<=N, 1<=j<=M)

Note that min and max are defined by the lexicographical order of strings (see Notes for a more formal definition), and A+B means the concatenation of strings A and B.

Your task is to find a substring of table[N][M]. Let L be the length of table[N][M]. Return the substring of table[N][M] whose start position (0-indexed) is pos and length is min(50, L-pos). 


DEFINITION
Class:STable
Method:getString
Parameters:string, string, long long
Returns:string
Method signature:string getString(string s, string t, long long pos)


NOTES
-A string X is defined as smaller than a string Y if and only if X is a prefix of Y or X has a smaller character than Y at the first position where they differ.
-The order of characters is defined by their ASCII codes: '0'<...<'9'<'A'<...<'Z'<'a'<...<'z'.


CONSTRAINTS
-s and t will each contain between 1 and 30 characters, inclusive.
-All characters of s and t will be distinct.
-No character of s will be present in t.
-No character of t will be present in s.
-s and t will contain only letters ('A'-'Z', 'a'-'z') and digits ('0'-'9').
-pos will be between 0 and L-1, inclusive, where L is the length of table[N][M] as defined in the statement.


EXAMPLES

0)
"ad"
"cb"
0

Returns: "acbacd"

In this case, the array "table" is as follows.

-----------------
| |  c   |  b   |
-----------------
|a|  ac  | acb  |
-----------------
|d| acd  |acbacd|
-----------------


1)
"fox"
"cat"
0

Returns: "acfcfoacftacfcfocfox"



2)
"Ra6b1t"
"W0lf"
66

Returns: "RWab0RWRWa0RWl0RWRWa6RWa0RWRWa6RWa6RWab0RWRWa6RWa6"

In this case, return 50 characters.
