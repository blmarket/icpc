PROBLEM STATEMENT

You are playing the funny game "Guess the number" with a friend. In this game, one of the
players chooses a positive integer and the other has to guess it by using the clues that are
revealed. The i-th clue is either "Y" or "N" indicating whether the hidden number is a multiple
of i or not, respectively. For instance, if the clues so far are "YYNYY" it means that the number
is a multiple of 1, 2, 4 and 5, but it is not a multiple of 3.

Note that some sequences of clues are invalid. For instance, the sequence "NYYY" is invalid because
all integers are multiples of 1, and therefore the starting element cannot be an "N". Also, a sequence
like "YNNY" is invalid because the answer cannot be a multiple of 4, but not a multiple of 2.

You will be given an int n. Return the number of valid sequences of n clues
for this game, modulo 1000000007.
