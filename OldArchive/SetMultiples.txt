PROBLEM STATEMENT
Suppose that S1 and S2 are sets of integer numbers. Let's call S2 a multiple of S1 if for each integer x from S1 there exist an integer y from S2 such that y is an integer multiple of x, i.e., y = k * x, where k is an integer.

You are given long longs A, B, C, D. Consider a set S consisting of integers x such that A <= x <= B or C <= x <= D. Return the number of elements in the smallest subset of S that is a multiple of S.

DEFINITION
Class:SetMultiples
Method:smallestSubset
Parameters:long long, long long, long long, long long
Returns:long long
Method signature:long long smallestSubset(long long A, long long B, long long C, long long D)


NOTES
-Since S is a subset of S and S is a multiple of S, the answer exists for any test case.


CONSTRAINTS
-A will be between 1 and 10,000,000,000, inclusive.
-B will be between A and 10,000,000,000, inclusive.
-C will be between B + 1 and 10,000,000,000, inclusive.
-D will be between C and 10,000,000,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
1
1
2
2

Returns: 1

Here S = {1, 2}. The subset {2} is a multiple of S because 2 is a multiple of both 1 and 2.

1)
1
2
3
4

Returns: 2

This time, S = {1, 2, 3, 4}. The subset {3, 4} is a multiple of S because 4 is a multiple of 1, 2 and 4, and 3 is a multiple of 3.


2)
2
3
5
7

Returns: 3

S = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}. The solution is {5, 6, 7}.

3)
1
10
100
1000

Returns: 500



4)
1000000000
2000000000
9000000000
10000000000

Returns: 1254365078
